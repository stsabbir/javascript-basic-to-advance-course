## Episode - 1 (Welcome & Introduction)
### [1. Wellcome to JavaScript Full Course](https://youtu.be/SsJgkZncFMU)
#### 1.1 What is the programing language?
- A programing language is a command that can make commands to our computer to finish some task.
- **For example**: Suppose, in a room have 2 people first one is Spanish and the second one is Bangladeshi. Both people have different mother tongues. So, now just ask yourself how they make conversation. Let me tell you, they didn't able to make any conversation if there are doesn't have 3hrd person. And the 3rth person is `Programing Language`. We know, the computer only knows `Machine Language` which means `0101010101` which is binary. So, we write any language to command our computer, and this language will make conversation with the computer. This is programming language concept clear?
#### 1.2 What is the JavaScript?
- JavaScript is a scripting language and a powerful and useful programing language.
#### 1.3 Why was it named  JavaScript?
- JavaScript started out as Mocha, then became LiveScript and then became JavaScript when Netscape and Sun got together. The name JavaScript is usually derived from Java in the first place.
#### 1.4 History of JavaScript
##### 1.4.1 What is the JS engine?
- An engine is a machine that can read something and return some output from it, usually using the JavaScript V8 engine.
##### 1.4.2 Names of various JavaScript engines?
```

##### 1.4.3 What can we do with JavaScript?
- We can do a lot of things with JavaScript. For example, we can build `Android` Apps, `IOS` Apps, `Desktop` Apps, `Windows` Apps, `Web` Applications, and Any kind of `backend` with `NodeJs`.
## Episode - 2 (Code Editor)
### [2. What is a code editor?](https://youtu.be/8RCRqfUdLvI)
#### 1.1 What is a code editor?
- The code editor is kind of a writing board or ledger.
- Which is help us write anything.
#### 1.2 How much code editor have...?
- Usually, the code editor is only 2 types.
1. IDE
> IDE stand for **Integrated Development Environment**
> The below section includes some most popular IDE. For example:
> - [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) -> `remember, it's not a Visual Studio code` it's a Visual Studio
> - [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) -> Basically, `Xcode is for only macOS`
> - [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) -> We know it's a very popular IDE
> - [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Lightweight Code editor
> - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) -> One of the best code editor for every developer.
> - [Atom](https://atom.en.softonic.com/)
> - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
> - [Brackets](https://brackets.io/)
> - [Nodepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
#### 1.3 Why we won't use Visual Studio Code or VS code
- Firstly, it's our learning time.
- For the learning purpose we have to understand everything from empty.
- `For example:` we don't know what is the English latter and how to make a word so, how can we write a `sentence`? How
- I know you haven't any answer to this question.
- However, at that moment we are going to learn and I hope you have enough time to understand everything step by step very well.
- So, don't worry about that. We will do no such thing which is throwing bad issues to the learning point. `REMEMBER IT`.
- For this purpose, we will use [Sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). For the download sublime then just [click me](https://www.sublimetext.com/download_thanks?target=win-x64).
- After that, just install it with my video instruction
